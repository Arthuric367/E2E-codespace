Task,EP-127,988814,Communication log for SMS,,,,"*Purpose:* 

Cost optimalization for notification sent quantity, especially on SMS.

PEC reference: HKD50,000/year for *all* channels



*Cost Estimated:* 

Assumption (Data average from 2022-2025): 

* Annual incidents = 30k
* Average customers = 6, affected customers = 180,000
* Number of messages = 3 (stages)
* Total = 30,000 * 6 * 3 = 540,000



Scenario: 

# Upper Limit (All message via SMS)
#* 540,000 * 0.0418 (USD per SMS) * 7.8 = *HKD 176,062*
# Average (Each 33%)
#* Email: HKD 20,000
#* App push: HKD 15,000
#* SMS: 540,000/3 * 0.0418 (USD per SMS) * 7.8 = HKD 58,687
#* Total: *HKD 93,687*
# Optimal
#* Email: HKD 20,000
#* App push: HKD 15,000
#* SMS: 43,000 (~8%) * 0.0418 (USD per SMS) * 7.8 = HKD 14,020
#* Total: *HKD 49,020*
# Assume no cost for email / App Push
#* Assume 3 msg for each, could inform 50,000 affected customers (~28%) would send SMS
#* SMS: 150,000 * 0.0418 (USD per SMS) * 7.8 = *HKD 48,906*
# Bottom Limit (All message via App Push + Email)
#* Around *HKD 35,000*



*Consideration:*

# Affected Customers

||*Affected customer for each incident*||*Sum of affected customers*||*No. of incidents*||
|1|10,430|10,430|
